#FSMBA:Fast and Secure Multi-hop Broadcast Algorithm
It is an algorithm created by Claudio E Palazzi and Wafa Ben Jaballah.It is based on the algorithm called Fast Broadcast which is also called as FMBA,Fast Multi-hop Broadcast Algorithm.

FSMBA try to solve the situation in which a malicious vehicle might inject incorrect information into the intervehicle wireless links,leading to life and moneyy losses or any other sort of adversarial selfishness.

Here is the source code of FMBA in NS2 Simulator.

##Fast Broadcast
###PROBLEMS
Applications such as online gaming and alert message propagation are sensitive to per-packet delivery delays. Consider a Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET); in this context, the quick propagation of multi-hop broadcast messages generated by the aforementioned applications requires the deployment of specific solutions able to avoid redundant transmissions and other sources of message propagation delays. 

###SOLUTIONS
We have developed a solution that allows vehicles in a car platoon to dynamically estimate their transmission range and to exploit this information to efficiently propagate a broadcast message with as few hops (and transmissions) as possible. In essence, the farthest vehicle in the transmission range of a message sender/forwarder will be statistically privileged in becoming the next (and only) forwarder.
