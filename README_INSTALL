Refer to: "NS by Example" (Section: Add New Appications and Agents)

All path-name start from ns2 root directory

/common/packet.h
- add inside packet_t
	PT_BROADCASTBASE, 
  before PT_NTYPE

- add inside p_info class 
	name_[PT_BROADCASTBASE]="BroadcastMSG";
  before_[PT_NTYPE]="undefined";

/common/ns-process.h
- add inside AppDataType 
	BBCAST_DATA, 
  before ADU_LAST

/tcl/lib/ns-packet.tcl
- add in the foreach prot
	BroadcastBase 
  at the end

/trace/cmu-trace.cc
- in the void CMUTrace::format(Packet* p, const char *why) function
  add inside the inner case:
	case PT_BROADCASTBASE:
		format_msg(p, offset);
		break;
			
/tcl/lib/ns-default.tcl
- add
	Application/BroadcastbaseApp set bmsg-interval_ 15
	Application/BroadcastbaseApp set bsize_ 100


/broadcast/
- create folder and copy:
	BroadcastbaseAgent.cc BroadcastbaseAgent.h
	BroadcastbaseApp.cc BroadcastbaseApp.h
	bbcast-packet.cc bbcast-packet.h
	
/Makefile
- inside OBJECT_CC add file depends : 
	broadcast/bbcast-packet.o
	broadcast/BroadcastbaseAgent.o
	broadcast/BroadcastbaseApp.o
	
Now you can run:
	- make clean
	- make depend
	- make
in the ns2 root directory

start simulation:
- ns broadcast.tcl
